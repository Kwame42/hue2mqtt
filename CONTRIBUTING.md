## Style Guide

### Elixir Style Guide

We follow the [Elixir Style Guide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide) and use `mix format` to ensure consistent formatting.

### Documentation

- All public functions must have `@doc` annotations
- All public functions must have `@spec` type specifications
- All modules must have `@moduledoc` annotations
- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Architecture

HUE2MQTT follows OTP principles with a supervision tree:

```
HueMqtt.Application
â”œâ”€â”€ Mqtt (MQTT client)
â”œâ”€â”€ Hue.Api (HTTP client)
â”œâ”€â”€ Hue.Conf (Configuration)
â””â”€â”€ Hue.Stream (Event streaming)
```

### Key Modules

- **Mqtt**: Handles MQTT broker communication and topic parsing
- **Hue.Api**: HTTP client with rate limiting for Hue bridge communication
- **Hue.Conf**: Configuration management and bridge discovery
- **Hue.Stream**: Real-time event streaming from Hue bridges

## Release Process

1. Update version in `mix.exs`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create a git tag: `git tag v0.1.0`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`
5. GitHub Actions will automatically publish to Hex.pm and Docker Hub
